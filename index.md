## What are Development Containers?

<img align="right" style="padding: 0.66em;" alt="Example devcontainer configuration" src="assets/example-devcontainerjson.png" />

A Development Container (or Dev Container for short) allows you to use a
container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an
application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a
codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can
be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud.

The Development Containers Specification seeks to find ways to enrich existing
formats with common development specific settings, tools, and configuration
while still providing a simplified, un-orchestrated single container option ‚Äì so
that they can be used as coding environments or for continuous integration and
testing. Beyond the specification's core metadata, the spec also enables
developers to quickly share and reuse container setup steps through Dev
Container Features and Templates.
